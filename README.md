# Independent Political Ad Spending (2004-2016)

## About Dataset
**What is an Independent Expenditure?**

Independent expenditures are what some refer to as "hard money" in politics - spending on ads that specifically mention a candidate (either supporting or opposing). The money for these ads must come from PACs that are independent of the candidate and campaign, and the PACs cannot coordinate with the candidate.

The Federal Election Commission (FEC) collects information on independent expenditures to ensure payers' independence from candidates.

## Executive summary

Between 2004-2016, independent political committees spent $4.8 billion on federal election advertising.

**Key Findings:**

- **$1.48B (31%)** was spent in the 2012 cycle alone (peak year)

- **70% of spending ($3.37B)** was used to oppose candidates

- **Top 10 committees controlled 38.4%** of all independent spending
